# Rockbuster-Analysis
*A bootcamp project that required writing SQL queries to join tables and retrieve required data, then visualizing the data in Tableau Public.*
## Project Description
For this project, I was provided a relational database and used PgAdmin 4 from Postgres to query this database. Here is a short list of some of the things I learned while completeing this project:
- How to use DBVisualizer to to build an entity relationship diagram
- The effects of constraints on how data can be input into a relational database
- Grouping and cleaning data in SQL
- Finding and displaying max, min, averages of data using SQL queries
- Writing relatively complex queries involving joins, subqueries and Common Table Expressions.

I was given a list of questions that hypothetical executives and managers at Rockbuster wanted answered, and had to write my own SQL queries to retrieve the data needed to answer them. The main areas if interest were:
- Basic statistical summaries of sales information
- Finding which countries on Earth produced the most sales 
- Determing the top cities within those countries
- Finding the top five customers within those cities

Sample queries can be found in the files of this repository.

Since most if this data exist on different tables, the main difficulty was in finding the correct keys to use to join and filter those tables correctly. 

In the end, the data we retrieved and organized was exported into CSV files and further visualized in Tableau. Here is a link to my [final project](https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/bryan7956/viz/RockbusterAnalysis_16577248885990/Story1?publish=yes), and here is a picture of the database ERD for reference:
