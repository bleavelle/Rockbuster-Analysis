# Rockbuster-Analysis
A bootcamp project that required writing SQL queries to join tables and retrieve required data, then visualizing the data in Tableau Public.
## Project Overview
For this project, we were provided a relational database and used PgAdmin 4 from Postgres to query this database. Here is a short list of some of the things we learned in while completeing this project:
- How to use DBVisualizer to to build an entity relationship diagram
- The effects of constraints on how data can be input into a relational database
- Grouping and cleaning data in SQL
- Finding and displaying max, min, averages of data using SQL queries
- Writing relatively complex queries involving joins, subqueries and Common Table Expressions.
